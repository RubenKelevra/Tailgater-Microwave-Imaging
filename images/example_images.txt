Example Images:
	I have included several example images to show what a scan looks like:
	 
	"dish_image example.png"  The result of running a default scan with dish_scan.py and 
				  processing with dish_image.py. Shows geostationary TV satellites.
				  
	"satellite overlay.png"   The previous file overlaid on a panoramic photo of the same area. 
				  Note that trees, roof overhangs, and power poles are visible in RF.
				  
	"satellite preview.png"   A scaled-up version of the "result" preview generated during a scan.
	
	"room overlay.png"        An overlay of a default scan run indoors, showing microwave RF
				  coming from a poorly-shielded PC tower (lower right). 
				  
	"house.png"		  A structure scan comparing KU band (with "hsv" colormap), visible
				  light, and 50% overlay of each. 
				  
	"tailgater.png"		  Example of the antenna unit used for this project.
